#design a python program for a univ system to manage student grades and evaluation, demostrating polymorphism: 
#1. method overriding: create a base class 'person' with a method get_role, create derived classes "student" and "class" that override get_role.
#2. method overloading: create a class "grade" with a method "calculate", using default argument to handle single or multiple marks.
#3. operator overloading: create a class "score" with attribute marks, overload the plus operator using add to sum two score objects.
#4. create objects and demostrate all types of polymorphism
